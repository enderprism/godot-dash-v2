# Folders
Folders are named using `snake_case`.

# Files
Files are generally named using `UpperCamelCase`, except for audio files located in `assets/sounds/music` or the trigger textures located in `assets/textures/triggers_imported`, which are ripped textures from GD that need porting.
When a file is a reusable component within the project, its name will start with `GD`.
Trigger scripts are prefixed with `t`.

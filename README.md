</p>

A Geometry Dash fangame made with Godot Engine. This is V2, a full rewrite of the project. Check V1 [here](https://github.com/enderprism/godot-dash) (or actually, don't, it's full of bugs and is unmaintained and people keep asking why Android doesn't work 😭).

## OS Support

Godot Dash V2 is intended to work on Linux, Windows and macOS (unsigned app). **Android support is not planned.**

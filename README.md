## OS Support

Godot Dash V2 is intended to work on Linux, Windows and macOS (unsigned app). **Android support is not planned.**

## Downloads

<!-- Head to the [releases](https://github.com/enderprism/godot-dash-v2/releases/) section and download the latest one. -->

As of right now, the game doesn't have any releases.
This is because it doesn't have any playable levels (the levels the game currently has are for testing purposes), and because the editor isn't finished.
Godot Dash V2 will start getting pre-releases as soon as the editor is completely usable (even if most objects from Geometry Dash are missing).

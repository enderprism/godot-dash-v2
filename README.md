 <h1 align="center">Godot Dash V2</h1>
</p>

A Geometry Dash fangame made with Godot Engine. This is V2, a full rewrite of the project.

I won't link to Godot Dash V1 because people it's buggy, unpolished and Android is broken.

## OS Support

Godot Dash V2 is intended to work on Linux, Windows and macOS (unsigned app). **Android support is not planned.**

## Downloads

<!-- Head to the [releases](https://github.com/enderprism/godot-dash-v2/releases/) section and download the latest one. -->

As of right now, the game doesn't have any releases. **This is normal.** I will make some when the game will have official levels (and will release the editor in a later release).

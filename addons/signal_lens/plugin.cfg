description="Signal Lens is a visual debugger for signal connections.
Given any node in a project, it will render a graph with all the connections to that node's signals while the project is playing in the editor.
It doesn't matter if that node is an autoload, or if the signal's are built-in, or custom made - Signal Lens will draw it all when given the node's global path in the remote."
